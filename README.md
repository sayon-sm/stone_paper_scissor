# Stone Paper Scissor Game

###### The game starts with a button click.

###### The user is then asked to enter a value: 1 for STONE, 2 for PAPER, or 3 for SCISSOR. The user can also type "stone," "paper," or "scissor" in either uppercase or lowercase letters.

###### Other values are not accepted; the default value STONE is used to continue. The user must enter a responseâ€”the input field cannot be left blank.

###### The verdict is displayed as an alert message and in the console. Standard game logic is used to decide the winner.

- Functions and control flow (if-else, function declarations)
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Randomization
- Game logic implementation
- User interface (UI) interaction
- Debugging & console logging
- Clean code practices
- Git & GitHub workflow
- Agile & modular development
